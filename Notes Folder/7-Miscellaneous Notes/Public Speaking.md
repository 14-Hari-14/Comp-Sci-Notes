# Public Speaking

### Managing Anxiety
 - Acknowledge the anxiety
 - Re-framing how we approach public speaking situations
	 - See the presentation as a conversation not as performance
		 - Start with questions (gets the audience involved and makes it resemble a conversation). When making a presentation if possible frame it as a series of question you are answering instead of bullet points about what you are going to talk about
		 - Use conversational language
	- Be more present oriented instead of worrying about future consequences
		- Do some physical activity like walking or listening to music to get you into the present moment. Or just count backwards from tough numbers. Tongue Twisters. 

### How to be more comfortable speaking in spontaneous situations

**Steps:**
1. Get out of our own way. (Point at random things and call them differently than what they are. Try not to stockpile words and try not to form patterns)
2. Change the way instead of seeing people asking you  questions as a threat see that as an opportunity to explain and expand. The approach you take when talking improv is **Maxim:** "yes and" instead of "no but"
3. Slow down and listen. **Maxim:** (Don't just do something stand there)
4. Structured information is processed 40% more reliably  (Never lose your audience) **Maxim:** Structure sets you free
	1. **2 Important types of structure to present in**
		1. Problem/Opportunity->Solution->Benefit
		2. What->So What->Now What
