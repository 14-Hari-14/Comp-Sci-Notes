### Moore's Voting Algorithm
Moore's Voting Algorithm is used for questions where u need to figure out the mode in a list of numbers or elements

Assuming that x is the mode 
if we encounter x we add 1 to flag/counter variable
if we encounter something else we subtract 1 

we start by randomly assuming (generally the first element) to be the max if the counter becomes 0 then switch the mode to be the next element
