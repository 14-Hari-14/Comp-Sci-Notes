### Forward Ray Tracing: 

Photons emitted by light source impact the pixels on the plane once the pixels by incrementally brightening them once the pixels are properly adjusted we get a computer generated image

**Disadvantages:**

This method assumes that each pixel will properly meet the eye however that is not the case even in real world we have thousand of photons moving at the speed of light scattering around thus we are able to see properly 

To optimise it we direct the photons to the eyes of the user since we know the approximate location this is an optimisation problem in this field

### Backward Ray Tracing or Path Tracing

Here we initiate the light from our eyes and then make it reflect from the object to the light source. 
We send another ray which if collided with the object the first ray becomes the shadow ray the first ray is called as primary, visibility, camera ray and the second ray becomes the shadow ray
