## Functional Requirements
- Statements of services that the product/system should provide(how to process input and how to behave in certain situations)
- May state what the system shouldn't do
- Imprecision here can lead to dispute between customers and developers
- Ideally should be complete and consistent

## Non Functional Requirements
- Constraints on the services or functions offered by the system during development such as timing constraints, constraints on development , etc
- Examples would be response time, reliability
- May generate more requirements like product, organisational, external requirements

## Requirements Engineering

4 activities for requirements engineering
- Requirements Elicitation
- Requirements Analysis
- Requirements Validation
- Requirements Management
