## Lithosphere 

The earth can be divided into 4 parts 
- **Inner core**
- **Outer core** 
- **Mantle** 
- **Athenosphere (ignore this)**
- **Crust**

### Inner core
Its a solid mass of iron with a radius of 1216 km 

### Outer core
Its the layer covering the inner core and its made up of molten metal like nickel and iron.
Its 2270 km thick

### Mantle 
Its the layer covering the outer core and its covered by a solid layer mantle
Its 2900 km thick

### Crust 
Its the layer all of us live on.
Its 5 km thick 

The crust and the mantle which is hard and brittle makes the lithosphere


LITHOSPHERE + ATMOSPHERE + HYDROSPHERE + BIOSPHERE = PEDOSPHERE -> contains biotic and abiotic components 


Lithosphere has 2 parts:
**Oceanic Lithosphere** -> its 5-8 km thick and is made up of basalt
**Continental Lithosphere** -> its 30-40 km thick

**Continental Plates** of the earth (7)
 - Africa 
 - Australia
 - Antarctica
 - Eurasia
 - North America
 - South America
 - Pacificea


**Minor continental plates**
- Adria 
- Arabia
- Philippines
- Caribbean 
- Nazca 

These plates can create 
 - divergent boundaries 
 - convergent boundaries 
 - wrench and transform boundaries 


### Composition of lithosphere
 - Oxygen -> 46.6
 - Silicon -> 27.7
 - Al -> 8.1

## Rocks
There are 3 types of rocks 
- **Igneous**
- **Metamorphic**
- **Sedimentary**

### Igneous Rocks

Solidification of magma in the interior or solidification of the lava in the exterior of the crust of the Earth.
Composed of primary minerals mostly silicates (since the mantle is also made up of mostly silicates)

### Sedimentary Rocks

Precipitation (water falling from the sky) from solutions and/or consolidation of the remnants of the biotic components mainly plants or animals 


### Metamorphic Rocks 

Also known as Thermal Rocks they are formed by preexisting rocks (igneous and sedimentary) due to change in temp or pressure. Igneous and metamorphic rocks undergo withering and form sediments which are then collected in banks and form sedimentary rocks


## Soil

Its the surface layer of the land.
Contains variable mixture of the broken and withered materials and decaying organic matter
Takes a lot of time to form naturally 
Formation is done by weathering and decomposition of rocks and minerals 
Dynamic layer constantly changing

### Function of soils
- provide mechanical support to the plants
- ability to hold water and has porosity -> reservoir of water
- Provides micro and macro nutrients and an ideal pH for the growth of microorganisms and plants 
- Prevents excessive leaching of nutrients 
- Houses bacteria that can fix nitrogen and other elements; fungi, bacteria protozoa and other microorganisms which help in the decomposition of organic matter


### Types of soil
- Volcanic ash
- Limestone
- Granite
- Sandstone 
- Basalt
