# DBMS Basics

### Levels of Abstraction
1. Physical Level (describes how a record is stored)
2. Logical Level (describes data stored in a db and the relationships among the data)
3. View Level (application programs hides the details of the data types) hides data for security purposes as well

### Schema 
Its a plan for organising data
Two types:
1. Logical Schema: the overall logical structure of the db (how to store the data)
2. Physical Schema: the overall physical structure of the db (how the files are stored and indexed in the db)

### Instance
The actual content of the database at any point in time


### Physical Data Independence 
The ability to modify physical schema without changing the logical schema


### Relational Model
- ER diagram for the db design
- Object(encapsulated concept of an entity which can be manipulated) based data models
- Semi structure model (XML)
